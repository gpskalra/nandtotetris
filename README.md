# nandtotetris
This repository is associated with the computer building course as described 
[here] (http://nand2tetris.org/ "The Elements of Computing Systems / Nisan & Schocken").
This repository contains the code required for projects 
and complete suite with filled in project submission files.
The coursera [course] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) currently 
teaches only the first half of the 
[book] (http://www.amazon.in/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1464841425&sr=8-1&keywords=elements+of+computing+systems).
This repository also provides code and project submission files for the later projects not 
currently a part of the coursera course.

# Description and Usage
The suite provided by the course instructors is contained in the folders 
projects and tools. The rest of the folders contain code and scripts required 
for the projects. The code required for the projects is in Java. The IDE used 
for the projects was IntelliJ. The configuration files required for IntelliJ are also 
provided. The repository can directly be loaded as an IntelliJ project. The Java projects
use Java SDK 1.7.0_79.

# Possible issues with the repository
The course proceeds through incremental projects. At some points, the previous projects'
code need to be modified for the next projects. The reader may find some documentation 
comments ambigious since they were not changed appropriately when changing the code.
Although, moving to the appropriate commit corresponding to the project may solve the problem.
Same holds true for some scripts written for running particular projects.
